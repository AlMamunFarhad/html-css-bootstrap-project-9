          <div class="col-md-12">
            <strong class="text-about">Graviola plant extract</strong>

            <p>Graviola is a tropical plant that is native to the Americas as well as the Caribbean. Antioxidants make up the vast majority of its content.</p>
            <p>In addition, it has an <strong>antiviral effect on the body</strong> of a human being. The creators of the product claim that Graviola extract has a role in the virus’s total eradication.</p>

            <strong class="text-about">Red raspberry fruit extract</strong>
            <p>Herpesyl also makes use of the red raspberry, which is another potent antioxidant in the formula. It is claimed that the red raspberry extract contained in the Herpesyl supplement would <strong>protect your cells by halting the processes that cause oxidative stress.</strong> In addition, it is common knowledge that red raspberries possess potent anti-aging qualities.</p>

            <strong class="text-about">Green tea leaf extract</strong>
            <p>This renowned and well-known leaf combines various ingredients to form a potent antioxidant mixture. In addition to this, it has a bioactive component that has the potential to<strong> improve brain function</strong> and calm the nervous system. It is one of the factors that contribute to the possibility of maintaining a healthy brain.</p>

            <strong class="text-about">Turmeric</strong>
            <p>Turmeric is a well-known herb that is used extensively and <strong>possesses anti-inflammatory qualities</strong> that are entirely natural.</p>

            <strong class="text-about">Shiitake mushroom</strong>
            <p>The fungus can only be found in natural environments, yet, it is most commonly found in kitchens, where it is referred to as a flavorful culinary mushroom.</p>
            <p>
            However, because it <strong>possesses robust antiviral characteristics that are beneficial,</strong> it is considered a benchmark in Traditional Chinese Medicine. It has also made its way into medicine practiced in modern times.</p>

            <strong class="text-about">Burdock root</strong>
            <p>Burdock root is well-known for having two primary uses, one in the synthesis of Herpesyl and the other in its general use. The first benefit is that it is an additional natural food that is rich in antioxidants and can be used in your kitchen.</p>
            <p>The second benefit is that it is a potent diuretic material mix, which <strong>causes the virus to be flushed out of the body</strong> as if it were poison.</p>

            <strong class="text-about">Grapeseed</strong>
            <p>Grapeseed, which is the seed that is extracted from grape vines, is yet another type of fruit that is rich in natural antioxidants. It may significantly enhance the balance and flow of your blood circulation, which directly assists your body in better fighting the removal of the herpes virus from your body.</p>

            <strong class="text-about">Quercetin seeds</strong>
            <p>It is believed that the Quercetin seed extract used in Herpesyl is so powerful that it may even be able to destroy or cure cancer cells, in addition to Herpes infections. It is because Quercetin seeds contain many antioxidants, making them highly effective.</p>

            <strong class="text-about">Selenium</strong>
            <p>In common parlance, selenium is “Selen,” a potent natural elemental antioxidant. Herpesyl makes use of selenium because of its powerful potential to <strong>improve a person’s immune system,</strong> as well as their nervous system and mental health. It is why selenium was selected for use in the product.</p>

            <strong class="text-about">Vitamin C</strong>
            <p>Vitamin C is an essential acid that helps the body recover from the effects of the herpes virus and various other imbalances that can occur in the human body. It may <strong>assist in the general healing process</strong> when fighting viruses and tremendously enhance your immune system.</p>

            <strong class="text-about">Vitamin E</strong>
            
            <p>Vitamin E is an excellent fatty acid vitamin that may help ensure that all existing <strong>antioxidants are distributed appropriately</strong> throughout the body. Vitamin E is a magnificent vitamin.</p>
            <p>It performs a function similar to that of a lubricant in that it helps to facilitate the movement of other beneficial substances to the locations and functions to which they are best suited within the body.</p>

            <div class="about-last pt-5">
              <h1 class="pb-3">What are the Unique Benefits of Herpesyl?</h1>
              <ul>
                <li><strong class="text-about">Drug and chemical-free</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Other treatment methods for herpes include using man-made ingredients, medically prescribed medications, and potentially harmful chemicals.</p>
              <p>Herpesyl, on the other hand, is not like that at all. If you read any review of Herpesyl, you will probably find that it mentions the <strong>absence of any negative side effects.</strong> </p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong class="text-about">Strengthened immune system</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Herpesyl can enhance the immune system sufficiently to fight off a newly released virus. Even while the primary objective of Herpesyl is to treat herpes, several user testimonials highlight the fact that it also <strong>enhances general immunological health.</strong> In this manner, you will easily fend off other diseases.</p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong class="text-about">Treats herpes at its source</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Herpesyl supplement includes a patented mixture of substances that, according to the manufacturer, cure the primary factor in herpes outbreaks.</p>
              <p>In addition to stimulating your immune system to eliminate the virus from your body naturally, this product’s ingredients also offer several operational benefits.</p>
              <p>Many of them have <strong>antioxidant properties and help to shield the cells.</strong> In addition, they may be effective against bacteria and parasites.</p>
            
              <ul>
                <li><strong class="text-about">Protects against HSV1 and HSV2 viruses</strong></li>
              </ul>
                <p>It is believed that taking Herpesyl regularly will provide continuous protection against subsequent infection. It acts as a kind of exercise for your immune system, preparing it to <strong>combat future herpes virus infections.</strong></p>
            
                <ul>
                  <li><strong class="text-about">Improved memory and brain function</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>ICP147 proteins, found in the brain, serve as a hiding place for the herpes virus. They can wreak a great deal of damage in that location.</p>
                <p>It is claimed by the pharmaceutical company that produces Herpesyl that removing the virus from the brain <strong>restores normal brain functions and improves memory.</strong></p>

            <p>The Herpesyl supplement contains a mixture of 26 different herbal extracts, vitamins, and minerals that have been properly mixed.</p>
           <p class="pb-3">They begin to be processed and absorbed by your body immediately after being consumed, and during this time, they effectively perform two functions.</p>

           <p class="section5-h"><strong>Phase 2: The brain starts the process of healing itself</strong></p>
           <p>The brain may start to mend itself not long after the connection between the virus, and the brain has been destroyed.</p>
           <p class="pb-3">The <strong>formation of new neuropathways</strong> will help and notify your immune system to begin the fight against the condition. Vitamins C and E, in addition to selenium, are active participants in this process and contribute significantly to its success.</p>
          <p class="section5-h"><strong>Phase 3: The herpes virus has been defeated and destroyed</strong></p>
           <p>The brain relays the message to the immune system that the battle has begun, the body may start the process of <strong>permanently removing the virus.</strong> </p>
           <p class="pb-3">As antiviral medicines, the herbal extracts included in the formulation of Herpesyl are a significant help in the battle against infection.</p>
